## d3-force
https://github.com/d3/d3-force

## What I like

* Classic, huge history, fast
* Ability to import as module using skypack.dev
* API is flexible, allows developers to add new forces

## What I don't like

* Documentation is a bit dry
* Examples on observable are intimidating - I'm not sure if I'm learning how to
use observable or d3-force library
* It is almost like an assembly language: Super powerful but requires a lot of
knowledge to be efficient.
* How to place labels?
