## What I like

* Clever and unique, like a breath of fresh air, it provides new tools for developers tool set.

## What I don't like

* It has learning curve, not approachable by beginners.
* It is slow.
* Examples source code are not explained really well
* Unless you are using a d3 wrapper, API is very dirty. E.g.:

```js 
// if you don't want layout to run automatically, you have to pass
// `false` as the fifth parameter after three other which you don't
// care about
layout.start(1, undefined, undefined, undefined, false)
```
