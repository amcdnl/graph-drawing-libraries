## Echarts - graphs

## Subjective notes

These are notes I collected during hello world implementation

What I like:

* Amazing documentation and variety of charts
* Consistent set of options that could be applied to various visualizations
* Switching between renderers is trivial

What I don't like:

* Couldn't find to load ESM in the browser
* Somewhat verbose configuration for a basic set of features.
* When configuration is not complete you can get a blank page without error explanation
* Some code was copied from D3, and n-body problem is solved in quadratic time.
