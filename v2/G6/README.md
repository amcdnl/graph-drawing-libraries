## Things I like

* Great example pages https://g6.antv.vision/en/examples/gallery
* Manual page makes it look like the best library https://g6.antv.vision/en/docs/manual/introduction
* Clear API to get started. Styling support of default nodes.
* Great error messages if something goes wrong

## Things I don't like

* I had grid rendered on first load properly, but after refresh of the page it all skewed for some reason.
* A few layouts are just bundled from other projects (d3 layout, dagre).
* Really bad default layouts configuration. Usually produces terrible results on a simple grid.
* Cannot pan and zoom by default
* Gave up trying after failing to get basic charts rendered correctly
